# Zindi International Women's Day Challenge Submission

## Overview
This repository contains a solution for the Zindi International Women's Day Challenge. The code implements a machine learning pipeline that combines CatBoost hyperparameter optimization with ensemble stacking and blending to predict the target variable. The solution follows Zindi's guidelines for reproducibility, good coding practices, and documentation.

- **Date**: April 1, 2025
- **Environment**: Developed and tested on Kaggle Notebooks
- **Hardware**: 2 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, no GPU

## Files
- `submission_script.py`: Main Python script containing the complete solution
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages with specific versions
- `README.md`: This file


### Instructions
1. **Create the Files**:
   - Copy the content of `submission_script.py` into a file named `submission_script.py`
   - Copy the content of `requirements.txt` into a file named `requirements.txt`
   - Copy the content of `README.md` into a file named `README.md`

2. **Using in Kaggle**:
   - Create a new Kaggle Notebook
   - Upload these three files using the "Add Data" or file upload feature
   - Add a cell at the top of your notebook with: `!pip install -r /kaggle/input/your-dataset/requirements.txt` (adjust the path based on where you uploaded it)
   - Copy the script content into a code cell and run

3. **Using Locally**:
   - Save all three files in a directory
   - Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure the data files are available at the specified paths or modify the paths in the script
   - Run `python submission_script.py`



This package is ready for Zindi submission and should run successfully in the Kaggle environment as specified! Let me know if you need any tweaks.
